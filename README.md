# I don't know what i am doing!

Yes, I really don't know what i am doing. This is a learning experince for me. I have coded in languages like Visual Basic .NET for my whole life so the syntax is vary foreign to me. I am sorry. There isn't much for me to learn from as Go is a new, but fast growing language.
